            <h2>Thrill of the Game</h2>
            <p class="funParagraph">There are eight key elements in creating an addiction. The first is liking the initial reason for supporting a team. 
               Why support Washington one would ask, especially if you're not from there? The&nbsp;prescense of fear and the following elements created a monster.
               The second element is reducing the suffering. As a Washington fan, I never understood how my pain was reduced, 
               but the thought of our past and return to the glory days is what I hold on to. 
               The third element is having a meaning. What better meaning is there than the pressure of your entire family being die hard fans?
               Which leads to the fourth element, memory. Since I could remember, I have been forced to be a fan of a team that has not won more 
               than two playoff games since my existance. This element ties directly to the fifth element, the desire for wanting more. 
               What fan doesn't want more for their team? Well, not many fans want more for their team than Washington Commanders fans. F***ing bums.
               If you ever took Psychology, what creates a want? Quick answer, the sixth element into any addiction. Craving. Craving for more, craving for 
               the better, craving for that high, but ultimately knowing, your cravings are just that. So following the hysteria of wanting and begging for 
               more, it turns into the seventh element, creating a habit. At this moment, it's far too late to quit cold turkey. Turning your back 
               on what you desire more than life itself causes you to fall into a pit of dispair, going back to the same spot, watching the same team, 
               praying for different results. One element remaining in the cycle of addiction and that's the withdrawl stage. At the end of every 
               season, regardless of the outcome, the instant stop of the addiction creates severe withdrawl symptoms for the next six months. But then, 
               it returns.. and the viscous cycle continues.</p>
